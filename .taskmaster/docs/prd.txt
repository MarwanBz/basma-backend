# Basma Maintenance Management System - Backend Development 

## Overview
Basma is a comprehensive maintenance request management system designed for Basma Real Estate Investment and Development Company. The system streamlines maintenance request handling across multiple properties and buildings, providing a role-based platform that enables efficient communication between customers, technicians, and management.

The backend serves as the core API that powers the entire ecosystem, handling authentication, request management, user roles, real-time updates, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Core Features

### Authentication & Authorization System
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens for secure session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions
- Email verification system for new user registrations
- Password reset functionality with secure token-based reset links
- Session management with automatic token refresh capabilities

### User Management System
- Five distinct user roles: SUPER_ADMIN, MAINTENANCE_ADMIN, BASMA_ADMIN, TECHNICIAN, CUSTOMER
- Hierarchical permission system with role-specific access controls
- User profile management with secure data handling
- User creation, modification, and deletion capabilities
- Role assignment and permission validation

### Maintenance Request Management
- Complete CRUD operations for maintenance requests
- Request lifecycle management: DRAFT → SUBMITTED → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED → CLOSED
- Priority system: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- Category-based request classification (Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Structural, Security, Cleaning, Emergency)
- Status transition validation with business rule enforcement
- Request assignment system (both self-assignment and manual assignment)

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket integration for real-time status updates
- Live notifications for request status changes
- Real-time dashboard updates for managers and technicians
- Connection management with rate limiting and authentication

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Prometheus metrics integration for performance monitoring
- Request resolution time tracking
- User activity monitoring
- System health monitoring with readiness and liveness probes
- Comprehensive logging system with daily rotation

## User Experience

### API Design Philosophy
- RESTful API design with clear, intuitive endpoints
- Consistent response formats with standardized error handling
- Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy integration

### Performance Requirements
- Request list loading: < 500ms response time
- Request creation: < 200ms response time
- Status updates: < 100ms response time

## Logical Dependency Chain

### Foundation Layer (Priority 1)
1. Database schema finalization and optimization
2. Authentication and authorization system completion
3. Core API endpoints for user and request management
4. Basic security middleware implementation
5. Error handling and validation systems

### Core Business Logic (Priority 2)
1. Request lifecycle management with all status transitions
2. Role-based permission enforcement
3. Assignment system (both manual and self-assignment)
4. Real-time updates via WebSocket
5. Basic reporting and statistics endpoints

### Enhancement Layer (Priority 3)
1. Advanced filtering and search capabilities
2. Performance optimization and caching
3. Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. Advanced security features
5. API documentation and testing infrastructure

### Production Readiness (Priority 4)
1. Load testing and performance tuning
2. Security auditing and penetration testing
3. Deployment automation and CI/CD
4. Monitoring dashboard setup
5. Documentation completion and user guides

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling
- **Concurrent User Load**: Use load testing to identify bottlenecks and implement caching strategies
- **Real-time Communication**: Implement WebSocket connection management with automatic reconnection
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits, dependency updates, and penetration testing

### Development Approach
- Start with MVP functionality to get core features working quickly
- Implement comprehensive testing from the beginning
- Use TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability
- Follow security best practices throughout development
- Implement monitoring and logging early for better debugging

### Resource Management
- Prioritize core business logic over advanced features
- Use existing, well-tested libraries and frameworks
- Implement proper error handling to prevent system crashes
- Plan for scalability from the beginning with proper architecture
