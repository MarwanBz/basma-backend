# Requests Handling Feature - Basma Maintenance Management System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive requests handling system for the Basma Maintenance Management System with role-based permissions. The system will allow different user roles to interact with maintenance requests according to their specific permissions and responsibilities.

## User Roles and Permissions

### SUPER_ADMIN
- **Full Access**: Can perform all operations on requests
- **Capabilities**:
  - Create, read, update, delete any request
  - Assign requests to any technician
  - Update request status to any state
  - Manage all users and system settings
  - View all reports and analytics
  - Access system-wide statistics

### BASMA_ADMIN (Maintenance Admin)
- **Limited Management**: Can manage requests within their scope but cannot perform maintenance admin tasks
- **Capabilities**:
  - View all requests as a viewer (read-only access)
  - View current/active requests
  - View reports and statistics
  - Cannot assign requests to technicians
  - Cannot manage users
  - Cannot update request status (this is maintenance admin work)
  - Cannot perform assignment operations

### TECHNICIAN
- **Task Execution**: Can work on assigned requests
- **Capabilities**:
  - View requests assigned to them
  - Update status of their assigned requests (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
  - Add comments and updates to assigned requests
  - Cannot assign requests to others
  - Cannot create new requests (unless they're also a customer)

### CUSTOMER
- **Request Creation**: Can create and track their own requests
- **Capabilities**:
  - Create new maintenance requests
  - View their own requests
  - Add comments to their requests
  - Cannot assign or manage other users' requests

## Core Features

### 1. Request Management System
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **Status Lifecycle**: DRAFT → SUBMITTED → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED → CLOSED
- **Priority Levels**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
- **Categories**: Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Structural, Security, Cleaning, Emergency
- **Location Tracking**: Building and specific location within building

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **Permission Matrix**: Implement granular permissions based on user roles
- **Route Protection**: Secure all endpoints with appropriate role checks
- **Data Filtering**: Return only data that users are authorized to see
- **Action Validation**: Prevent unauthorized actions at the service layer

### 3. Request Assignment System
- **Manual Assignment**: SUPER_ADMIN and MAINTENANCE_ADMIN can assign requests
- **Self-Assignment**: TECHNICIANS can self-assign available requests
- **Assignment Validation**: Ensure only authorized users can perform assignments
- **Assignment History**: Track who assigned what to whom and when

### 4. Status Management
- **Status Transitions**: Enforce valid status transitions based on business rules
- **Role-Based Updates**: Only authorized roles can update specific statuses
- **Status History**: Track all status changes with timestamps and user information
- **Automatic Status Updates**: System can automatically update statuses based on conditions

### 5. Reporting and Analytics
- **Dashboard Views**: Role-appropriate dashboard data
- **Request Statistics**: Counts by status, priority, category, time period
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, completion rates, technician workload
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports in various formats

### 6. Real-time Updates
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time status updates and notifications
- **Live Dashboard**: Real-time updates for managers and technicians
- **Notification System**: Alert users of important status changes

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
- **Existing Models**: Leverage existing `maintenance_request`, `user`, and `request_category` models
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships between users and requests
- **Indexes**: Optimize queries with appropriate database indexes
- **Constraints**: Enforce data integrity with database constraints

### API Endpoints
- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST conventions for all endpoints
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for list endpoints
- **Filtering**: Support filtering by status, priority, category, date range
- **Sorting**: Allow sorting by various fields
- **Search**: Full-text search capabilities

### Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control on all operations
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with rate limiting
- **Audit Logging**: Log all important operations for security

### Performance
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database Optimization**: Optimize queries and use proper indexes
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination to handle large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Load related data only when needed

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Request Management
1. Create request service with CRUD operations
2. Implement request controller with all endpoints
3. Set up request routes with proper middleware
4. Add comprehensive input validation
5. Implement role-based access control

### Phase 2: Assignment System
1. Create assignment service and logic
2. Implement assignment endpoints
3. Add assignment validation and business rules
4. Create assignment history tracking

### Phase 3: Status Management
1. Implement status transition validation
2. Add status update endpoints
3. Create status history tracking
4. Implement automatic status updates

### Phase 4: Reporting and Analytics
1. Create reporting service
2. Implement dashboard endpoints
3. Add statistics and metrics calculations
4. Create export functionality

### Phase 5: Real-time Features
1. Integrate WebSocket service
2. Implement real-time notifications
3. Add live dashboard updates
4. Create notification system

## Success Criteria
- All user roles can access appropriate functionality
- BASMA_ADMIN can view but not manage requests
- SUPER_ADMIN has full control over the system
- Request lifecycle is properly managed
- Assignment system works correctly
- Real-time updates function properly
- System is secure and performant
- Comprehensive test coverage
- API documentation is complete
