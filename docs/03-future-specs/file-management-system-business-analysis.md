# Extensible File Management System - Business Analysis Document

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive business analysis for implementing an Extensible File Management System (EFMS) for the BASMA Maintenance Platform. The system will enable secure file upload, storage, and management capabilities with polymorphic relationships to support multiple entity types, starting with maintenance requests and expanding to other platform entities.

## 1. Business Context

### 1.1 Current State
- BASMA platform manages maintenance requests without file attachment capabilities
- Users currently describe issues verbally or through text descriptions
- No visual documentation or supporting document sharing exists
- Technicians lack access to photos/documents for better issue assessment

### 1.2 Business Problem
- **Poor Communication**: Text-only descriptions limit understanding of maintenance issues
- **Inefficient Workflows**: Technicians cannot preview issues before site visits
- **Documentation Gaps**: No visual record of issues or completed work
- **Customer Dissatisfaction**: Limited evidence of work completion and issue resolution

### 1.3 Business Opportunity
- **Enhanced Service Quality**: Visual documentation improves issue understanding and resolution
- **Operational Efficiency**: Better preparation reduces site visit time and costs
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation for compliance and quality assurance
- **Platform Extensibility**: Foundation for future file-based features
