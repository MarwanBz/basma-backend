# Product Requirements Document: Technician API Endpoints

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature implements basic technician management API endpoints that allow administrators to view technician lists and individual profiles, while technicians can view their own profile information. The endpoints provide a foundation for technician management within the maintenance request system.

## 2. Goals

- Enable administrators to view all technicians in the system
- Allow administrators to view individual technician profiles
- Permit technicians to view their own profile information
- Provide consistent API responses with pagination metadata
- Maintain proper authorization and security controls

## 3. User Stories

- **As a SUPER_ADMIN**, I want to view all technicians so that I can manage the technician workforce
- **As a MAINTENANCE_ADMIN**, I want to view all technicians so that I can assign maintenance requests
- **As a TECHNICIAN**, I want to view my own profile so that I can verify my information
- **As an administrator**, I want paginated technician lists so that I can efficiently browse large technician databases

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. **GET /api/technicians**
   - Returns paginated list of all users with role TECHNICIAN
   - Supports pagination via query parameters (page, limit)
   - Default pagination: page=1, limit=10
   - Returns metadata: page, limit, total, totalPages
   - Requires SUPER_ADMIN or MAINTENANCE_ADMIN role

2. **GET /api/technicians/:id**
   - Returns specific technician profile by ID
   - Requires SUPER_ADMIN, MAINTENANCE_ADMIN, or self (if TECHNICIAN)
   - Returns 403 if TECHNICIAN tries to access another's profile
   - Returns 404 if technician not found or not a technician

3. **Response Format**
   - Consistent with existing API patterns
   - Includes success flag and data object
   - Pagination metadata for list endpoints

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Creating or updating technician profiles (CRUD operations)
- Technician skills management
- Availability tracking
- Performance metrics
- Assignment optimization algorithms
- Mobile-specific endpoints

## 6. Technical Considerations

- Uses existing `user` table with `role = 'TECHNICIAN'` filter
- No database schema changes required
- Follows existing authentication and authorization patterns
- Implements proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Includes Swagger documentation

## 7. Success Metrics

- API endpoints return correct data for authorized users
- Unauthorized access attempts return 403 Forbidden
- Non-existent technicians return 404 Not Found
- Pagination works correctly with metadata
- Response times under 200ms for typical queries

## 8. Open Questions

- Should we include additional technician-specific fields in future iterations?
- Do we need filtering capabilities (by department, status, etc.)?
- Should we implement caching strategies for frequently accessed technician lists?

## 9. Example API Responses
